# IRCDLocal

IRCDLocal is an irc server which is not really meant to be used as a
full blown irc daemon, but to act as a gateway between different
protocols and an irc client of your choice.

The objective is to enable usage of any irc client (and there are a lot
of good ones out there) for interacting with non irc networks and
services like campfire, twitter, etc...
